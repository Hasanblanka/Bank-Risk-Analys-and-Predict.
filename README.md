# Bank-Risk-Analys-and-Predict.
Bank Credit Risk Analysis Project
This project aims to analyze credit risk for bank applicants based on historical data. The project includes the following steps:

-Data Cleaning: Addressing missing, inconsistent, or erroneous data.
-Data Preprocessing: Feature engineering, data normalization, and processing of categorical variables.
-Model Building: Developing models using various machine learning algorithms to predict credit risk.
-Model Prediction: Testing the developed models and making risk predictions.
-Clustering: Grouping customers based on credit risk profiles and analyzing the segments.

The project incorporates various machine learning techniques and data analysis methods to provide actionable solutions for predicting real-world credit risk. The code and analyses are implemented using Python and relevant libraries.
